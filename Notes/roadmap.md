# 🧠 AI/ML Learning Roadmap

## 🎯 Purpose
This repo documents my journey learning **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** — from foundations to applied experiments.  
Instead of just collecting random code, I’ll keep track of my **understanding, experiments, and reflections**.

---

## 📚 Foundations (Month 1–2)
- **Math Basics**
  - Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices, dot product, eigenvalues).
  - Calculus (derivatives, gradients).
  - Probability & Statistics (Bayes theorem, distributions).
- **Programming & Tools**
  - Python refresher (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).
  - Jupyter notebooks for experiments.

---

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Basics (Month 2–3)
- **Supervised Learning**
  - Linear Regression, Logistic Regression.
  - Decision Trees, Random Forests.
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - K-Means Clustering.
  - PCA (Dimensionality Reduction).
- **Key Concepts**
  - Bias-variance tradeoff.
  - Overfitting & regularization.
  - Train/test split & cross-validation.

---

## 🤖 Deep Learning (Month 4–5)
- **Neural Networks Basics**
  - Perceptrons, activation functions.
  - Forward & backward propagation.
- **Architectures**
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs, LSTMs).
  - Transformers (attention mechanism, BERT, GPT).
- **Frameworks**
  - PyTorch basics.
  - TensorFlow/Keras.

---

## 📄 Applied Learning (Month 6+)
- Build **mini projects**
  - Image classification (MNIST, CIFAR).
  - Sentiment analysis on text.
  - Recommendation systems.
  - Small chatbot using transformers.
- Start **paper summaries**
  - Read 1 research paper/month.
  - Write a short summary in `Papers/`.

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Vision
- Use this repo as a **portfolio of AI/ML growth**.
- Each folder (Notes, Experiments, Papers) will reflect both technical skills and my ability to learn, explain, and apply.
- Goal: bridge DSA (CodeChronicles📖) with ML (AI-Chronicles🤖) → becoming strong in both theory and application.
